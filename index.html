            <h3>1. The problem</h3>
            In the long history of architecture, the provider and the consumer have had a decisive roll, with a fixed one route sequence, selling designs to the client. Since the advent of computers and increasing technologies within, the activity of “designing” has shifted to a dynamic phase giving equal opportunity to any individual. This impact has the potential to alter the process of design that was long kept sacred.
            Our question to tackle for the next age of design is how to create an system that incites various subjects. This includes not only humans in present, but relativizing and communicating with past thoughts from individuals or collaborating with computers as form generators.

            <h3>2. meaning of existence</h3>

            The rise of digital design enhanced individuals to create more and more proposals at a given time. This is only the beginning of the rising era of digital design, pregnant with the potential to multiply the number of participants in the design process. The invention of a control system is urgently needed to confront the immersive wave of creativity. While the issues like the relation of architecture and the evaluation from the society will still persist, new questions will arise such as the reinterpretation of “originality” when the world is so inexpensive to copy and paste. Both new and old queries will be illuminated from the explosion of subjects participating in the process.

            <h3>3.Similar contexts and previous considerations</h3>

            Few attempts in atchitecture has made to tackle similar approaches: such as licensing the drawings and the documents with new methods invented from the field of software architecture.  C.C House from Yasutaka Yoshimura declares the project to be maintained by the creative commons license, making it possible to sell and propagate successive designs. The GPL House from LEVI ARCHITECTURE exposes not only the drawings but the computer simulation tool that was subsequently developed for the project. Yet neither of the projects have observed what happened after the attempt, and how the inheritance worked within the publication. The methodology is yet to be invented.
